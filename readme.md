# SimpleStaff

### Version 1.0.0

## About SimpleStaff:

1. _SimpleStaff allows for staff in the server to talk to one another without other people being able to see their messages. This allows for your staff to plan / communicate in private and not have the intrusion of other members in the server._

2. _SimpleStaff comes with the ability for logging within the server to keep track of people that talk in staffchat all together._

## Configuration:

1. Logging:

   - SimpleStaff comes with a logging system built into the script, you can configure the options that are listed below in the config.lua.

   6. Webhook Link: _You can change the URL of where the embed is sent to._

2. Usage of Ace Permissions:
